The "Hello World". A thing that all Computer Scientists remember.

Hello world. I'm Arron, a graduate Computer Scientist and an enthusiast for Software. I also love the web. I made my first website back in school when Macomedia's [Dreamweaver]('https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html', 'Better than FrontPage, I guess.') was relevant. I was hooked ever since. Since then, I've progressed through college and university and now I work as a Software Engineer at a company in Nottingham.

At this time, I'm not entirely sure what I'll be using the website for, perhaps exhibiting current and previous projects and maybe engage in some blogging.
